Excel Data Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project focuses on **data analysis using Microsoft Excel**. It demonstrates the use of **advanced Excel formulas**, functions, and data manipulation techniques to extract insights, automate calculations, and visualize data effectively.  

The project is designed to showcase how Excel can be used as a powerful analytical tool without the need for programming languages like Python or R.


Key Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning** and **transformation** using Excel functions.  
- Apply **advanced formulas** such as:
- `VLOOKUP`, `HLOOKUP`, `INDEX`, `MATCH`
- `IF`, `IFS`, `AND`, `OR`
- `SUMIF`, `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGEIF`
- Date and text manipulation functions.
- Create **dynamic dashboards and reports**.  
- Present insights through **charts and pivot tables**.
